<h3 class="h2after1" id="st0015">Study Break 1.1</h3><p id="p0010" class="textfl"><a id="P151"/><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 3</p>
<p id="p0015" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0020" class="text">Assessing the normal bowel pattern in a client with possible constipation provides the information to determine an appropriate response to the client&#8217;s concern. Note that two interventions (1 and 4) are similar and can be eliminated. Nursing interventions to correct the constipation should be performed before notifying the HCP and requesting medical intervention.</p>
<p id="p0025" class="text"><strong>2</strong>. Correct Answer: 3</p>
<p id="p0030" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0035" class="text">Remember to address ABCs first. The objective is to assist the client in using the accessory muscles of breathing. Raising the head of the bed farther will keep the spine straight, decrease pressure on the diaphragm, relax the abdominal muscle to improve breathing, and will assist the client to breathe easier. This intervention addresses breathing, which would be the priority. Although the RN might call the HCP, obtain the pulse oximeter, and assess the client&#8217;s vital signs, these would not be done <em>first</em>.</p></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0020">Study Break 1.2</h3><p id="p0040" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 3</p>
<p id="p0045" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0050" class="text">Informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any invasive or surgical procedure. The RN needs to notify the HCP that the client has questions concerning the procedure that must be addressed by the HCP. The consent form cannot be witnessed until all client questions have been clarified to obtain informed consent. It is not the nurse&#8217;s responsibility to answer the client&#8217;s questions. Reassuring the client that the surgeon will answer their questions does not address the issue and therefore should not be stated.</p></section></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="st0025">Chapter 2</h2><section><a id="s0030"/>
<h3 class="h2after1" id="st0030">Study Break 2.1</h3><p id="p0055" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 1</p>
<p id="p0060" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0065" class="text">To delegate tasks to unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP), the registered nurse (RN) must be knowledgeable regarding the parameters of the state&#8217;s nurse practice acts. Delegation of an assessment that requires nursing judgment to a UAP is inappropriate. The other answer options do not apply to this scenario.</p>
<p id="p0070" class="text"><strong>2</strong>. Correct Answer: 2</p>
<p id="p0075" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0080" class="text">Nurses should not discuss client information in public settings, as it is a violation of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). This is a violation of client privacy and confidentiality and should be stopped immediately. All other options should be completed but advising them to cease their communication should occur <strong>first</strong>.</p></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0035">Study Break 2.2</h3><p id="p0085" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 2</p>
<p id="p0090" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0095" class="text">This client is awake and alert and is capable of making decisions regarding health care procedures at this time. Therefore, the living will has not been activated, and all plans for care should be discussed with the client before intubation takes place. A living will does not <span id="page_152" aria-label="Page 152" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>remove the client&#8217;s ability to make medical decisions and all lifesaving procedures should still be explained to the client. The client should be asked if he or she has a durable power of attorney for health care to make medical decisions. After the client has been intubated and possibly sedated, they cannot communicate health care decisions.</p></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0040">Study Break 2.3</h3><p id="p0100" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 4</p>
<p id="p0105" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0110" class="text">The client&#8217;s behavior places the client at high risk for self- harm. Restraints may be applied to protect the client from injury after all other measures to protect the client have been attempted. The health care provider (HCP) can prescribe restraints only once all other less restrictive interventions have failed. Staffing issues are not legal indications for restraining a client. Wandering at night and other client concerns are also not reasons for applying restraints.</p></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0045">Study Break 2.4</h3><p id="p0115" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 3</p>
<p id="p0120" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0125" class="text">Think safety. An involuntary admission is based on the risk for harm to self or others; therefore, assessment of harmful behaviors is the highest priority. The other options are of lesser priority but will be conducted during the admission process and assessment.</p></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0050">Study Break 2.5</h3><p id="p0130" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 4</p>
<p id="p0135" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0140" class="text">Asking the client or knowing if the client has received pain medication prior to signing and witnessing the surgical consent form is essential. Pain medications can alter a client&#8217;s ability to think clearly and make medical decisions. Consent should be obtained, and the signature witnessed, if possible, before pain medications are administered. The other questions are components of the preoperative checklist and should be reviewed with the client and family prior to the procedure.</p></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0055">Study Break 2.6</h3><p id="p0145" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 4</p>
<p id="p0150" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0155" class="text">The charge nurse should encourage the staff nurse to be accountable for their own behavior. Displacing blame on other members of the staff is not an appropriate response and should be addressed immediately by the charge nurse. The charge nurse should not confront the other staff members about the policy change. Confrontation should be avoided, and a discussion should take place instead. This could be handled in a unit meeting that discusses the reason these changes were made. However, this meeting is not the priority action at this moment. For future occurrences, a written policy for expression of complaints should be developed for the unit or facility.</p></section><section><a id="s0060"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0060">Study Break 2.7</h3><p id="p0160" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 3</p>
<p id="p0165" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0170" class="text">Measuring vital signs on the uninjured arm of an elder client does not require the expertise of the RN to be performed. The other actions are beyond the scope of practice for a UAP and should be completed by the RN. Furthermore, medications should never be left at a patient&#8217;s bedside as stated in option 2.</p>
<p id="p0175" class="text"><strong>2</strong>. Correct Answer: 3</p>
<p id="p0180" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0185" class="text">Performing a sterile wound irrigation is within the scope of practice for the licensed practical nurse (PN) and is an appropriate assignment for the charge nurse to make. Maintaining a 24-hour urine collection can be performed by one of the UAPs and the other can gather the scheduled vital signs. A RN should be responsible for weaning a client from a mechanical ventilator.</p>
<p id="p0190" class="text"><strong>3</strong>. Correct Answer: 4</p>
<p id="p0195" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0200" class="text">Variance or incident reports are used for unusual circumstances that require investigation by the facility <span id="page_153" aria-label="Page 153" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to prevent further occurrences. A client who receives medication that was prescribed to another client is an example of a medication variance and requires reporting using the facility&#8217;s incident reporting procedure. This incident should be recorded and investigated to ensure that the occurrence does not reoccur with another client. An incident where a client refuses to take their medications or has status improvement does not require documentation via an incident report but should be documented in the chart. Although an allergic reaction is a concerning incident, this type of reporting is not appropriate. The HCP should be notified of the allergic reaction and the allergy should be noted on the client&#8217;s chart.</p></section><section><a id="s0065"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0065">Study Break 2.8</h3><p id="p0205" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 3</p>
<p id="p0210" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0215" class="text">The RN should not discuss or gossip about a problem with a fellow coworker during shift handoff. This incident should be addressed with the UAP to ensure the incident does not happen again. It is inappropriate to discuss the incident in the shift report and undermine the competency of the UAP. The oncoming RN should be made aware of client concerns and what client teaching has been performed. Using the electronic medical record ensures accurate reporting during handoff communication and is recommended to provide accurate medication administration history information. Reducing the likelihood of interruptions during handoff is an effective communication technique.</p></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0070">Study Break 2.9</h3><p id="p0220" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer(s): 2, 4</p>
<p id="p0225" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0230" class="text">A client receiving IV piggyback vancomycin and a client with a wound vacuum-assisted closure would be appropriate assignments to give to the PN. The client needing an x-ray can be assigned to the UAP. A client on a client-controlled analgesia pump of hydromorphone could need more advanced monitoring, which would be more appropriate for the RN. Also, blood transfusions must be initiated and supervised by an RN.</p>
<p id="p0235" class="text"><strong>2</strong>. Correct Answer(s): 1, 4</p>
<p id="p0240" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0245" class="text">The client with unstable angina and the postoperative client with chest tubes need advanced monitoring and assessment that are most appropriate for the RN. The client needing a bed bath can be assigned to the UAP. The client with the enteral feeding and the client needing urinary catheterization could be assigned to the PN.</p></section></section><section><a id="s0075"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="st0075">Chapter 3</h2><section><a id="s0080"/>
<h3 class="h2after1" id="st0080">Study Break 3.1</h3><p id="p0255" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 2</p>
<p id="p0260" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0265" class="text">The client&#8217;s respiratory rate is 6. The RN should administer naloxone 0.4 mg IV immediately. One of the side effects of hydromorphone is respiratory depression. The other nursing interventions need to be completed but are not the priority.</p></section><section><a id="s0085"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0085">Study Break 3.2</h3><p id="p0270" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>.

<p id="p0300" class="text">The serum potassium level is severely low. Normal potassium level is between 3.5 and 5 mEq/L (3.5&#8211;5 mmol/L). This electrolyte imbalance can lead <span id="page_154" aria-label="Page 154" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to deadly dysrhythmias and must be resolved prior to starting an operative procedure. This requires immediate contact of the health care provider (HCP). The other labs are within normal limits and do not require contact of the HCP.</p></section><section><a id="s0095"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0095">Study Break 3.4</h3><p id="p0305" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 3</p>
<p id="p0310" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0315" class="text">Viral load testing directly measures the actual amount of HIV viral RNA particles in blood and is used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are monitored to determine progression of the disease. The ELISA test confirms a diagnosis of HIV. There is currently no vaccine for HIV.</p></section><section><a id="s0100"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0100">Study Break 3.5</h3><p id="p0320" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>. Correct Answer: 4</p>
<p id="p0325" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0330" class="text">The client receiving intracavity radiation must be placed in a private room due to the chance of radiation contamination.

Correct Answer: 2</p>
<p id="p0340" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0345" class="text">This client has low hemoglobin and low hematocrit, which indicate anemia due to chemotherapy. The client should eat a diet rich in iron. Steak, spinach, and grains are good sources of iron. The other foods are not the highest sources of iron.</p>
<p id="p9000" class="text"><strong>2</strong>. Correct Answer: 1</p>
<p id="p9005" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p9010" class="text">A normal stoma is pink and moist. A dry, dark red stoma after surgery may indicate infection or other complication such as decreased blood flow. The RN should notify the HCP of the finding immediately. All other interventions do not address the complication noted with the stoma appearance.</p>
<p id="p9015" class="text"><strong>3</strong>. Correct Answer: 2</p>
<p id="p9020" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p9025" class="text">The client who is 48 hours postoperative and is complaining of nausea and vomiting would need to be assessed first. These symptoms could be an indication of a paralytic ileus which is a medical emergency and would need to be reported to the HCP immediately. All the other clients are not experiencing symptoms that could be life-threatening and would need to be assessed following this client.</p>
<p id="p9030" class="text"><strong>4</strong>. Correct Answer(s): 2, 3, 5</p>
<p id="p9035" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p9040" class="text">A change in mental status and swelling/redness to the client&#8217;s lower left leg could indicate serious postoperative complications and should be reported immediately to the RN. The client&#8217;s vital signs indicate a low-grade fever that needs to be reported as well. Pain is a concern but can be assessed by the PN. The amount of drainage is small and does not need to be reported to the RN.</p></section></section><section><a id="s0110"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="st0110">Chapter 4</h2><section><a id="s0115"/>

<p id="p0355" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0360" class="text">Nursing interventions to correct shock are focused on correcting decreased tissue perfusion and restoring cardiac output. Increasing the intravenous fluid rate will help to expand blood volume, which will increase tissue perfusion and cardiac output.</p>
<p id="p0365" class="text"><strong>2</strong>. Correct Answer: 1</p>
<p id="p0370" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0375" class="text">This is a client with a known cardiac history whose symptoms align with cardiac problems. The client has increased work of breathing with respiratory rate of 24. The priority in this client is to maximize perfusion to the myocardium. The registered nurse (RN) should ensure adequate oxygenation before implementing other interventions.<span id="page_155" aria-label="Page 155" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/></p></section><section><a id="s0120"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0120">Study Break 4.2</h3><p id="p0380" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>.

<p id="p0435" class="text">The order in which actions would be performed according to BCLS guidelines is 2, 4, 1, 6, 7, 5, 3. First, determine the client&#8217;s level of responsiveness, breathing adequacy and if there is a pulse present. Then, initiate a call for help by activating code team. Then. move the client to the floor so you can begin high quality chest compressions. You deliver 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths.

<p id="p0445" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0450" class="text">The client with partial- and full-thickness burns to the chest is at greatest risk for respiratory issues and should be assessed first to ensure airway and breathing are maintained. The client with partial-thickness burns to the lower extremities and confusion is showing signs of possible deterioration and should be assessed next. The older client should be seen next, and the younger client with superficial burns can be seen last in this group.</p>
<p id="p0455" class="text"><strong>2</strong>. Correct Answer: 4</p>
<p id="p0460" class="text"><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p id="p0465" class="text">A red tag would be assigned to the client with an open wound to the abdomen, and a deformed right femur, pulse 125, delayed capillary refill, respiratory rate 32, and who is moaning. A yellow tag would be given to the client with bruising and swelling of the right forearm, but has normal capillary refill with a respiration of 18. Green goes to the client helping others. A black flag would go to the client with agonal breathing, the last gasping breaths before dying.</p></section><section><a id="s0135"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="st0135">Study Break 4.5</h3><p id="p0470" class="textfl"><strong>1</strong>.
